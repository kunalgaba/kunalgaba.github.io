Recently, I played with Amazon Alexa Skills kit and Amazon AWS lambda. The Amazon Alexa skills kit is a set of APIs which Amazon has opened up so that as a developer you can set up custom voice skills for Amazon Echo or for your custom hardware which uses Amazon voice service.

With Alexa SDK APIs now you can use Amazon voice service with natural language processing to build custom use cases or voice interactions which are not available out of the box with Amazon echo. For an example - you can add a new skill to read today's horoscope of a sun sign or a skill to read out the scores of a sports game.

I created a skill which reads latest tweet from a user timeline.
